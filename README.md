# 👋 Howdy, I'm Nick!  
## Aka "The Tinkering Nerd"  

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub, where old-school curiosity meets cutting-edge innovation. 🚀 It's a mix of fun project's, random stuff, or broken projects. 

I'm all about diving into new adventures—whether it's
- working toward my pilot's license ✈️
- tinkering with electronics 🔌
- capturing the perfect shot 📸
- jamming to some killer tunes 🎶
- or just enjoying the ride

Life’s too short to stick to one lane, right? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
